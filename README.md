## Recipes List

A simple website with links to a few of my favorite recipes. Clicking on a recipe will foward you to the recipe page which will contain the ingredients and instructions. I will be putting to use the skills learned so far in the foundations portion of this course which includes:

- Creating directories/files in the terminal
- Creating HTML boilerplate
- Using basic HTML tags, including anchors and images
- Using HTML attributes & working with absolute/relative paths
- Making meaningful and timely commits

Reflections after completing initial assignment: Fairly simple and straight-forward using basic HTML elements. Found a few issues when validating html files with validator.w3.org, some elements outside of body tag and warnings on self closing tage(generated by Prettier formatter)
